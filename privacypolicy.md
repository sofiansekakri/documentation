Effective Date: July 30, 2025

1. Introduction
Welcome to the WikiConnect Bot ("the Bot"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Bot collects, how it's used and shared, and your rights regarding this information.

This Bot acts as an interface between Discord and the Fandom platform. This policy solely covers the data handled directly by the Bot. Your interactions are also governed by the Discord Privacy Policy and the Fandom Privacy Policy.

By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

2. Information We Collect
The Bot is designed to be minimal in its data collection, only gathering what is necessary for it to function.

Information You Provide Directly:

Command Inputs: When you use a command, we process the content you provide. This includes things like Wiki page titles (for /wiki-read), usernames (for /rank, /user-info, /block), and reasons/durations (for /block). This information is used only to process your immediate request and is not stored.

Information Collected Automatically:

Discord User and Guild IDs: Like all Discord bots, we receive your unique Discord User ID (interaction.user.id) and the Guild ID (interaction.guild.id) where the command is used. We use your User ID solely to verify permissions for restricted commands (e.g., /debug and the administrator check for /block). These IDs are not stored.

Information We Do Not Collect:

We do not collect or store email addresses, passwords, or any other personal information from your Discord or Fandom accounts.

We do not track your activity across different websites or servers.

We do not read your messages in channels, other than the specific slash commands directed at the Bot.

3. How We Use Your Information
The data we process is used exclusively for the following purposes:

To Operate the Bot: To receive your commands, query the Fandom API, and return the requested information to you in Discord.

To Secure the Bot: To perform permission checks and ensure that administrative commands are only used by authorized individuals (e.g., Discord Administrators for the /block command).

To Troubleshoot and Maintain: A temporary, in-memory log of recent Bot activity (command usage and errors) is maintained for debugging purposes. This is explained further in the Data Storage section.

4. Data Storage and Retention
We believe in data minimization and do not store your personal information.

No Permanent Database: The Bot does not use a database or file system to store user data or command history.

Temporary Debug Logs: For maintenance and troubleshooting, the Bot keeps a small, temporary log of recent events in its memory (debugLogBuffer).

This log is limited to the last 20 events.

It is volatile, meaning it is permanently erased every time the Bot restarts.

Access to this log is restricted to authorized Bot developers via the /debug command.

No other information is retained.

5. Information Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to others. Information is shared only in the following ways:

With Fandom APIs: To fulfill your requests, the Bot sends queries containing the data you provided (e.g., a username for /user-info) to Fandom's public APIs.

With Discord's API: The Bot's entire operation runs on Discord's platform. All messages sent and received pass through Discord's servers.

Other than these essential service providers, we do not share any data with any other third parties.

6. Your Rights and Data Control
Because the Bot does not store your personal data, the concept of data control is straightforward.

Access and Deletion: There is no personal data stored by the Bot to access or delete. Any data you wish to manage exists on the Fandom or Discord platforms themselves.

Opting Out: You can stop the Bot from processing any of your data at any time by simply not using its commands. Server administrators can remove the Bot from their server.

7. Children's Privacy
The Bot is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in a designated channel or via the Bot itself. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
