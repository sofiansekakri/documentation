# Terms of service
Effective Date: July 30, 2025

1. Acceptance of Terms
By adding or using the WikiConnect Bot ("the Bot") in your Discord server, you, your server members, and all users ("you," "your," "User") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("ToS"). You also agree to abide by the Terms of Service of Discord Inc. and the Terms of Use of Fandom. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Bot.

The Bot is designed to act as an interface to the Backrooms Fandom Wiki ("the Wiki"). All data retrieved and actions performed are subject to the policies and availability of the Fandom platform and its API.

2. Description of Service
The Bot provides users with tools to interact with the Wiki directly from Discord. Its functionalities include:

Data Retrieval Commands:

wiki-read: Fetches and displays the text content of a specified Wiki page.

rank, rank-daily, rank-monthly: Displays leaderboards of Wiki editors based on the number of recent edits.

user-info: Retrieves public user profile information from the Fandom platform.

staff: Lists the current administrators and moderators of the Wiki.

Administrative Commands:

block: Allows a Discord user with "Administrator" permissions to block a user on the Wiki. This is a real, privileged action on the Fandom platform.

debug: A restricted command for authorized personnel to view diagnostic logs.

3. User Conduct and Responsibilities
You agree not to use the Bot for any of the following purposes:

To spam, harass, or disrupt the service of the Bot, the Discord server, or the Fandom Wiki API.

To attempt to exploit or reverse-engineer the Bot.

To perform any action that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Fandom's Terms of Use.

Accountability for Administrative Actions:
The block command performs a moderation action on the Wiki. Any User who executes this command is solely responsible for their action. The Bot is merely a tool executing the request. Misuse of this command may result in consequences on both the Discord server and the Fandom platform. The owners and developers of the Bot bear no liability for actions taken using this command.

4. Data and Privacy
The Bot is designed to be stateless and prioritizes user privacy.

Data Processed: The Bot processes command inputs (e.g., page titles, usernames) and your Discord User ID to fulfill requests and check permissions. This data is used ephemerally and is not stored long-term.

Data Storage: The Bot does not maintain a database of user data.

Logging: For troubleshooting purposes, the debug command accesses a temporary in-memory buffer of recent Bot actions and errors. This log is restricted to authorized developers and does not contain sensitive personal information.

Third-Party Data: The Bot queries public data from Fandom's APIs. All data retrieved is subject to Fandom's Privacy Policy. The Bot does not collect or store any private Fandom user data.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Bot is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. The developers and maintainers of the Bot make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Bot's reliability, accuracy, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Data retrieved from the Fandom API is provided as-is and its accuracy is not guaranteed.

6. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the developers or maintainers of the Bot be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, damages resulting from:

Inaccurate information provided by the Bot.

Actions taken using the Bot's administrative commands (block).

Downtime of the Bot, Discord, or the Fandom API.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Bot's developers from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Bot.

7. Availability and Modification of Service
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot's service at any time, with or without notice. We also reserve the right to modify these ToS at any time. Continued use of the Bot after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

8. Contact
If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact the Bot's maintainer at [crazylosthismind#0].
